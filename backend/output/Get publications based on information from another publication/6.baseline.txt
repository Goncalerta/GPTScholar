I've read "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models". Great paper, thank you for the recommendation. Could you give me another paper writen by one the its authors?

I'm glad you found the recommendation helpful! The paper "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer" is another notable work by one of the authors of "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models." This paper, authored by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J. Liu, introduces the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model, which demonstrates the potential of large-scale transfer learning on a diverse range of language tasks. I hope you find this recommendation interesting as well!

Give me papers written in the same year as "World-wide web: the information universe."
------------------
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to specific papers or their publication dates. "World-wide web: the information universe" is an article written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. If you are looking for papers written in the same year, I suggest visiting academic databases or research libraries that specialize in computer science and information technology. These sources typically have extensive collections of papers from various years.

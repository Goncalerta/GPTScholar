I've read "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models". Great paper, thank you for the recommendation. Could you give me another paper writen by one the its authors?

Sure! I found another paper written by Tom B. Brown, one of the authors of "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models". The paper is titled "Scaling Laws and Interpretability of Learning from Repeated Data". It was published in 2022 in the CoRR journal. Here is the DOI for the paper: [http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.10487](http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.10487). Enjoy reading!

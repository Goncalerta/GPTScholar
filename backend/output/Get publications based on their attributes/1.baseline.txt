Retrieve articles from ROBIO published before the year 2018
------------------
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to specific databases or content such as articles from ROBIO (IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics) published before the year 2018. 

To access articles, you can try the following options:

1. IEEE Xplore: Visit the IEEE Xplore digital library website (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) and use its search feature to look for ROBIO articles published before 2018.

2. ResearchGate or Academia.edu: These platforms often have researchers who make their published articles available for free. You can search for the specific authors or papers related to ROBIO and explore their profiles or publications.

3. University or institutional libraries: Many universities provide access to various databases and research publications. You could visit your university library's website or physical location to search for articles related to ROBIO published before 2018.

4. Request through inter-library loan: If you have difficulty accessing specific articles, you can request them through inter-library loan services offered by most libraries. This service allows you to borrow resources from other libraries.

Remember to check the availability, copyright restrictions, and licensing terms associated with each option.

Retrieve publications by Ashish Vaswani published no later than 2015.
------------------
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have real-time data or the ability to browse the internet to retrieve specific publications by individuals. However, Ashish Vaswani is a well-known researcher in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). To find his publications before 2015, I recommend searching academic databases such as Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, or the ACL Anthology. These platforms allow you to search for academic papers by specific authors and filter them based on publication dates.

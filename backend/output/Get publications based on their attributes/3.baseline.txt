I am interested in knowing if Leslie Lamport published any paper before the 80s. If so, what are they?
------------------
Yes, Leslie Lamport has published several papers before the 1980s. Here are some of his notable works:

1. "Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System" (1978): This seminal paper introduced the concept of logical clocks and established important principles for ordering events in distributed systems.

2. "A New Solution of Dijkstra's Concurrent Programming Problem" (1974): In this paper, Lamport presented an improved solution to the mutual exclusion problem, solving a challenge proposed by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra.

3. "How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs" (1979): Lamport's paper explored the concept of "Byzantine failures" in multiprocessor systems and provided a method for building fault-tolerant computers.

These are just a few examples of Leslie Lamport's work prior to the 1980s. He has made numerous contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in distributed systems, concurrency, and formal methods.

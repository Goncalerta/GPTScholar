I want to know more about "Optimization" through papers. Could you give me a list of concrete papers that could interest me?
------------------
Certainly! Here is a list of concrete papers on optimization that cover a range of topics and can be of interest:

1. "Convex Optimization" by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe: This influential book covers various aspects of convex optimization, including theory, algorithms, and applications.

2. "A Tutorial on Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Training Artificial Neural Networks" by H. Robbins and S. Monro: This classic paper introduces the stochastic approximation algorithm, which is widely used for optimizing neural networks.

3. "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by D.P. Kingma and J.L. Ba: This paper introduces the Adam optimizer, a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning.

4. "Linear Programming and Extensions" by G.B. Dantzig: This seminal paper introduces linear programming and the simplex algorithm, which is a fundamental technique in optimization.

5. "Sparse Recovery via Convex Optimization" by Emmanuel J. Candès, Michael B. Wakin: This paper discusses sparse signal recovery, a problem widely encountered in signal processing, and demonstrates its efficient solution using convex optimization.

6. "Proximal algorithms" by Neal Parikh and Stephen Boyd: This survey paper provides an overview of proximal algorithms and their applications in solving convex optimization problems.

7. "Globally Convergent Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization" by Y. Nesterov: This paper presents efficient algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems that guarantee global convergence to a stationary point.

8. "Quasi-Newton methods: a new direction" by D.C. Liu and J.Nocedal: This paper explores the family of Quasi-Newton methods, which are widely used as alternatives to the Newton's method for optimization.

9. "The Submodular Secretary Problem and Its Extensions" by V.S. Mirrokni and M. Zadimoghaddam: This paper discusses submodular optimization problems and their applications, along with algorithms for solving them.

10. "Optimization Methods for Large-Scale Machine Learning" by L. Bottou, F.E. Curtis, and J. Nocedal: This survey paper covers optimization techniques tailored for large-scale machine learning problems, discussing both first-order and second-order methods.

These papers cover various subfields of optimization and provide a good starting point for a deeper understanding of the subject.

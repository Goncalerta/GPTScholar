I am interested in "Machine Learning". Could you give me a list of papers about it?
------------------
Certainly! Here is a list of influential papers in the field of machine learning:

1. "A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning" by Pedro Domingos (2012)

2. "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" by Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira (2009)

3. "Deep learning" by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton (2015)

4. "A Few Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner (1998)

5. "Large-scale matrix factorization with distributed stochastic gradient descent" by Danny Bickson and Carlos Guestrin (2011)

6. "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2018)

7. "A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backpropagation Networks" by Radford M. Neal (1995)

8. "The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory" by Vladimir N. Vapnik (1995)

9. "Random Forests" by Leo Breiman (2001)

10. "Support-Vector Networks" by Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik (1995)

These papers cover a variety of topics within machine learning, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks, and other fundamental concepts.

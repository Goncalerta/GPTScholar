Fetch me two papers authored by Leslie Lamport
------------------
Here are two papers authored by Leslie Lamport:

1. "Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in Distributed Systems" (1978) - In this seminal paper, Lamport presents the notion of a logical clock and its role in ordering events in a distributed system. It introduces the concept of "happened-before" relationship and provides algorithms for achieving a consistent ordering of events.

2. "The Byzantine Generals Problem" (1982) - This paper addresses the problem of achieving consensus in a distributed system when faulty processes, known as Byzantine generals, may send contradictory messages. Lamport introduces an algorithm called the "Byzantine Generals Problem" algorithm, which provides a solution to the problem and ensures agreement, despite the presence of faulty processes.

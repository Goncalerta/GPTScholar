Give me 5 articles written by Dijkstra
------------------
1. "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" - This groundbreaking article by Dijkstra, published in 1968, argues against the use of the "go to" statement in programming languages, highlighting its detrimental effects on program readability and maintainability.

2. "On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science" - In this thought-provoking piece, Dijkstra expresses his concern about the inadequate teaching methods in computer science education. He emphasizes the importance of a solid theoretical foundation and rigorous education in computer science.

3. "A Case against the GOTO Statement" - Dijkstra further expands upon his criticisms of the "go to" statement in this article, published in 1973. He presents a compelling case against its use, arguing that structured programming constructs are essential for producing reliable and maintainable software.

4. "The Humble Programmer" - This personal reflection by Dijkstra, originally published in 1972, highlights the qualities and mindset of a humble programmer. Dijkstra emphasizes the need for humility and modesty in software development, pointing out the complexity and challenges inherent in the field.

5. "EWD on the Duality of Programming and Mathematical Reasoning" - In this article, Dijkstra explores the fundamental relationship between programming and mathematical reasoning. He argues that programming should be seen as a form of mathematical problem-solving, and highlights the importance of mathematical rigor in software development.
